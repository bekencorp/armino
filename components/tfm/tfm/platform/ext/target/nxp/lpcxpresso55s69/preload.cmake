# preload.cmake is used to set things that related to the platform that are both

# that uses this platform. In practise this is normally compiler definitions and
# variables related to hardware.

# Set architecture and CPU
set(TFM_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR cortex-m33)
set(TFM_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE armv8-m.main)


# Set processor type for NXP SDK
